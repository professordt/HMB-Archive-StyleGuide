Hamboning Media LLC Style Guide for Assets and Archives
=======

Welcome to the Hamboning Media Archive Style Guide repository! This guide outlines the structure, naming conventions, and best practices for organizing and naming digital assets within the Hamboning Media Archive system.

This guide is meant to be used by the Hamboning Media team, collaborators, and any automated systems for consistency across all projects.

## Structure:
- **Naming Conventions**
- **Folder Structure**
- **Backup Strategy**

This represents a work-in-progress company wide structure as we catalog and prepare our digital assets. For branding style guidelines, please see the Notion pages. 

Start by reviewing the [Naming Conventions](NamingConventions.md) to align all your files with the archive's organizational system.
