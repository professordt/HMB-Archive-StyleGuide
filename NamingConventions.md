# Naming Conventions

The file naming convention is based on a structured format to ensure easy organization and retrieval:

## Format:
'YYYYMMDD_BRANDID_ProjectID_ItemDescription_Revision.ext'

### Example:
`20250401_PDT_XPDT_LoadQuest_02.psd`

Where:
- **YYYYMMDD**: Date the file was created or finalized.
- **BRANDID**: The brand or identity of the project (e.g., PDT, SU, JBW).
- **ProjectID**: A short, unique identifier for the project.
- **ItemDescription**: A human-readable description (e.g., file type, name).
- **Revision**: Version number or draft indicator (e.g., `01`, `FINAL`).
- **ext**: The file extension (e.g., `.psd`, `.mp4`).

### Versioning:
Use 2-digit revision numbers (e.g., `01`, `02`, `FINAL`) for consistency.


## LOGOS
Logos and other official images that are used on the website or for social media and opengraph should be formatted as such:

'BrandID_Logo_Description.ext'

### Example:
'SU_Logo_Words.png'

Where:
- **YYYYMMDD**: Date the file was created or finalized.
- **BRANDID**: The brand or identity of the project (e.g., PDT, SU, JBW).
- ** Description88: Brief description such as words or nobackground (nobg)

Be aware that these are special case scenarios and are meant to keep the logos identifiable across brands. All other filename conventions should use the default naming conventions.
